Extra credit (20 points) if you can explain how the decoding circuitry can tell the difference between immediate addressing mode (I) and register addressing mode (R).
The decoding circuitry can tell the difference between the immediate addressing mode and the register addressing mode by examining the opcode and certain fields included 
in the instruction to differentiate between the immediate addressing mode (I) and the register addressing mode (R). When using instantaneous addressing, the instruction 
uses an immediate value that is already included in the instruction. The instant instructions are found by looking at the instruction's opcode, and the appropriate fields,
such the immediate value field, are verified to extract the constant value. In contrast, while using register addressing mode, the instruction works with register-stored data.
The elements inside the instruction, such as the source register fields, are used to identify the precise registers involved in the operation once the opcode has been analyzed 
to identify register instructions. The decoding circuitry can therefore precisely detect whether an instruction follows the register addressing method or the immediate addressing
mode by looking at the opcode and pertinent fields. This distinction is important because it allows the circuitry to appropriately retrieve the operands from the proper sources
and execute the instruction as intended.
